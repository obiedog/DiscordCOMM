# DiscordCOMM
 
This simple python script runs in the background to make discord PTT act like a COMM box. 

# Defaults
**Discord Toggle Mute**: Right-ALT + m

**Script Input**: Left-ALT

# Usage
Script Input acts as a normal push to talk key

When muted and pressed twice quickly the PTT will latch on. 

Press Script Input again to unlatch. 

Just like clearcomm :)
